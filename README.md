3D Scanner Project by Group 4

This is 3D scanning software, it was implemented as part of a software engineering project. The full setup includes a Kinect v2 and a turning table. The person or object to scan would be on this table. The table will start turning and the kinect will start capturing PCD files. We then process those PCD files and reconstruct the 3D body using different techniques and algorithms in the field. The instructions on how to run the software is provided in the User Manual.
